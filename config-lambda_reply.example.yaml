# ----------------------
# Property: stream_name
# ----------------------
# Description: The name of the lambda function which will be sent the scraped events.
#
function_name: kworker

# --------------------
# Property: batch_size
# --------------------
# Description: How many events per batch should be sent to the lambda.
#
# Note: The Kinesis-SLR will preserve the original event Records structure Kinesis normally sends to the lambda as
# possible. However, the following values will be X due to the getRecords call not having this information.
#  - event.Records[].eventID
#  - event.Records[].invokeIdentityArn
#  - event.Records[].awsRegion
#  - event.Records[].eventSourceARN
#
batch_size: 100

# --------------------
# Property: local_dlq
# --------------------
# Description: Utilizes a local dlq (/dlq directory) to dump failed messages in the same manner they would
# be sent to an SQS dlq.
#
local_dlq: True

# -----------------------------
# Property: local_dlq_fullevent
# -----------------------------
# Description: If true, rather than utilizing AWS' metadata-only contents a DQL message normally contains
# when being sent to an SQS dlq, the Kinesis-SLR will instead drop the exact .json file it builds when
# scraping events to disk. This allows for a "second replay" of any dlq'd messages to occur by simply
# deleting all the event messages from the events directory, then copying the .json files from the /dlq
# directory back into the events directory and re-running the replay option.
#
local_dlq_fullevent: True

# -------------------------
# Property: retry_attempts
# -------------------------
# Description: The number of times a retry
#
local_dlq: True
